The Rmd file type allows you to run chunks of R code, and comment on this code in a way which is legible. Annotated code can be quite hard to follow if you are using it to give a full report.

You can also use Rmd to add the formulae which your code is using to your report, like so:
$$
        F_n+k = (L_n+k \times b_n)\times S_{n+k+s}
$$
with $k=1$ and $s=12$
